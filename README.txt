Offensive Flags Mod v1.0
By Nigel Farage, adapted from the prideflags mod by Leslie E. Krause

Offensive Flags adds a variety of animated flags, at least one of which is guaranteed to be
offensive to someone. If you can't find a flag in this mod that outrages you, please submit a PR 
and I'll add some more flags.

The flags and poles are non-craftable and intended for placement by an administrator in a
conspicuous location, so as to annoy and alienate as many users as possible. If you find there's
nothing worse than a load of players running around, digging up holes all over your server, then 
this mod could be the right choice for you.

  /giveme offend_flags:mast_lower
  /giveme offend_flags:mast_upper

By default, a "Re-elect Donald Trump" flag will appear when the upper mast is placed, as this is
deemed to be the least offensive flag of the lot. Hard to think why anyone would be offended by
that, in fact. Right-click the node to select a more offensive flag.
